# Parachain Guide Resources

> _This is meant to be followed with the [Parachain Development Guide by W3F](https://education.web3.foundation/docs/introparachain)_.

This repository contains the **compiled** runtimes, JSON, and SCALE encoded chain specifications for quickly running a local, native relay and parachain setup.

This is primarily for learning purposes and to learn at a more granular level how to provision networks from scratch.  For a more ready-made solution to provision and spawn networks which includes a CLI, please use [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet).
